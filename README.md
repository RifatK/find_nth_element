Simple Python function that takes a list and an integer which represent the postion in the ordered list 
and returns that value. The benefit is this function does not sort the complete list and only sorts the 
section of the list where it expects the n'th element to be.

For example :

>>>list=[4,2,1,3,8,7,10,9,6]
>>>print(find_nth_element(list,2)) 
>>>2
